# Age calculator
  A simple android app that informs you of your age in days, weeks, months & seconds.
  You enter in your age using the in-built calendar (DatePicker)

  *Min SDK version: API level 26* (using the Java Date and Time API, but I could potentially 
  support older APIs in the future if I used Joda)
