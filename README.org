* Age calculator
A simple android app that informs you of your age in days, weeks, months & seconds.
You enter in your age in years

*Min SDK version: API level 26* (using the Java Date and Time API, but I could potentially support older APIs in the future if I used Joda)

* Currently working on...
- Letting the user input their date and birth, and then calculate the age based on that (instead of
  based on someone's age in years, which leads to a crude approximation)
