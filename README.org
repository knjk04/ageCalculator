* Age calculator
A simple android app that informs you of your age in days, weeks, months & seconds.
You enter in your age using the in-built calendar (CalendarView)

*Min SDK version: API level 26* (using the Java Date and Time API, but I could potentially support older APIs in the future if I used Joda)
